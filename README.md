# Algos
This repo holds algorithm challenges I have completed or am working. For each algorithm,
I am documenting whether the solution passes or fails, the complexity, and documenting
my thought process as I iterate through different solutions.

In each folder you will find files are prefixed with the version. Each time I iterate
on a solution, I will create a new file.
